- Constructor/destructor chaining
- Diamond inheritance problem

**Exercises:**
- **ex00**: ClapTrap base class
- **ex01**: ScavTrap inheritance

- **ex03**: DiamondTrap multiple inheritance

### CPP04 - Polymorphism & Abstract Classes
**Concepts Covered:**
- Runtime polymorphism vs compile-time binding
- Virtual functions and pure virtual functions
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Deep vs shallow copying
- Design patterns (Factory, Prototype)
- Correct vs incorrect polymorphism implementation

**Exercises:**
- **ex00**: Animal polymorphism basics + WrongAnimal/WrongCat (demonstrates incorrect polymorphism)
- **ex01**: Deep copy with Brain class
- **ex02**: Abstract Animal class (same main as ex01, but Animal cannot be instantiated)
- **ex03**: Materia system with interfaces

**Resources:**
- `resources/deep_copy_vs_shallow_copy.tldr`: Visual diagram explaining deep vs shallow copying concepts

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learning Objectives

### Memory Management
- Understanding stack vs heap allocation
- Proper use of `new` and `delete`
- Avoiding memory leaks and dangling pointers
- Deep copying for classes with pointer members

### Object-Oriented Design
- Encapsulation and data hiding
- Inheritance hierarchies
- Polymorphic behavior through virtual functions
- Interface design with pure virtual functions

### C++ Best Practices
- Orthodox Canonical Form implementation
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- Proper constructor/destructor chaining
- Forward declarations to avoid circular dependencies

### Design Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: MateriaSource creates different materia types
- **Prototype Pattern**: Materia cloning system
- **Interface Segregation**: Pure virtual interfaces

## ðŸ”§ Compilation

Each module includes a Makefile with standard rules:
```bash
make        # Compile the project
make clean  # Remove object files
make fclean # Remove object files and executable
make re     # Recompile everything
```

All projects are compiled with:
- C++98 standard compliance
- Wall, Wextra, Werror flags for strict error checking

## ðŸ“– Resources & Documentation

- **CPP02/resources/note.txt**: Comprehensive guide to IEEE 754 floating-point representation
- **CPP04/resources/deep_copy_vs_shallow_copy.tldr**: Visual diagram explaining memory copying concepts

## ðŸš€ Progressive Complexity

The modules are designed with increasing complexity:

1. **CPP00**: Basic C++ syntax and simple classes
2. **CPP01**: Memory management and references
3. **CPP02**: Operator overloading and canonical form
4. **CPP03**: Inheritance and virtual functions
5. **CPP04**: Advanced polymorphism and design patterns

Each module builds upon concepts from previous modules, creating a comprehensive learning path through C++ object-oriented programming.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- **Memory Safety**: Proper allocation/deallocation patterns
- **Polymorphism**: Runtime behavior selection through virtual functions
- **Design Patterns**: Reusable solutions to common programming problems
- **C++98 Compliance**: Understanding legacy C++ standards and constraints
- **Code Organization**: Proper header/implementation file separation
- **Error Handling**: Defensive programming with null checks and bounds validation

This repository demonstrates a complete journey from basic C++ concepts to advanced object-oriented design patterns, providing a solid foundation for modern C++ development.
